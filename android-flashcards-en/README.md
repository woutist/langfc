# Basic-Android-HTML5-WebApp-Template
Basic Android HTML5 WebApp template that you can start with and improve as you like.

Watch the demo video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtfUjYKr2Ys

It works like a bridge between JavaScript and Android WITHOUT Cordova or Phonegap. You can trigger some of native Android functions from JavaScript, such as:

- Showing AdMob Banner Ad
- Hiding AdMob Banner Ad
- Showing AdMob Interstitial Ad
- Showing AdMob Rewarded Ad and receiving reward callback
- Changing screen orientation (landscape or portrait)
- Showing toast message
- Sharing a text using Android native sharer
- Opening Google Play to encourage users to rate the app
- In App Purchase to remove ads from this app

Hope you will like it, and...
